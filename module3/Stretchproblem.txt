Good:
- good initialization if no input is passed.
- The way he measure the execution time

Bad:
does not check for invalid inputs.

assuming N has been defined previously, I assumbe N is a very large number
because it is probably there to compensate for any input. This means that
if you dont use all the array size based on the input parameters,
the host allocate a lot of memory that will be unused both on the CPU and GPU.
