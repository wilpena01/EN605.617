Good:
- The way he breaks down the code is pretty efficient
- The way he measure the execution time
- The way he declare the GPU functions using __device__ 




Bad:
- Does not check for invalid inputs.
- Do not initialize the number of block and the number of threads in case no input is provided.
- Does not declare the function named "outputCardInfo" in the code.
- the value of N is not declared in the main function.
- N has to be declared as global variable because it is using it in the GPU and CPU.
