Good:
- good initialization if no input is passed.
- The way he measure the execution time
- The implementation of the pageable memory allocation is correct.
- Does not check for invalid inputs.
- Properly freed the data from the GPU


Bad:
- Do not initialize the number of block and the number of threads in case no input is provided.
- The pinned memory allocation is wrong.
- Did not have any memory location in the Host side.
